This app shows you all pokemon up to the forth generation. As soon as you enter a pokemon card, its description and its move set appear on the screen.<br>
Besides searching for specific Pok√©mon by its name, you can also ask your phone to read the pokemon description outloud for you by clicking on the button underneath the description.<br>
It's a good project for anyone who wants to practice things like parsing data to JSON object, trying out different types of GridItems, and displaying data you receive from an API on the screen.<br>
